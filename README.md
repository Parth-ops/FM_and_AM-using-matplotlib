# Frequency-Modulation-using-matplotlib
## This repository contains the code for the demonstration of an FM and AM wave using static and dynamic plots .

## Instructions
1. Open up terminal and type: `pip install requirements.txt`
2. After all the modules are installed run the file using:
    - To run AM simulation: `python AM_dynamic.py`
    - To run FM simulation: `python FM_dynamic.py`
    - To run FM graph:      `python FM_static.py`
